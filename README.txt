SETUP
1. Add files to your videos folder and name each file using the format "Video1" for the first file, "Video2" for the next and so on...
Video file should be MP4 and for at least 2 min longer to avoid the video ending before the timer

2. Open the "Beat the Queen" HTML file in your browser of choice - two options are available for video sound ON or OFF
3. Set the number of videos in your folder and click "SET" - If you leave it blank - it will only play the first file in your folder over and over
4. Click "Start Game" and have fun!

HOW IT WORKS
The script shuffles a deck of 52 cards and randmizes the videos in your folder
The script draws a card, and plays the first random video at a random start point between 0 and 60sec
The script sets the video border to either green or red depending on the card drawn
The script starts a timer. The max time is zero and lower cards produce lower timers +/- a small random factor
When the timer reaches 0, the next card is drawn and a new video is played with an appropriate border colour

The script also randomly decides to be either KIND, A LITTLE MEAN or VERY MEAN
If KIND - it will ignore the first QUEEN drawn - slightly improving your odds at a desirable outcome!
If A LITTLE MEAN - it will ignore the first BLACK JACK drawn - worsening your odd at a desirable outcome
If VERY MEAN - it will ignore the first BLACK JACK and bias the cards to more RED suits at the start of the deck

NOTES
- Yes the odds are purposely stacked against you getting to finish!
- Feel free to change the script as you see fit for your own purposes!

Enjoy!
